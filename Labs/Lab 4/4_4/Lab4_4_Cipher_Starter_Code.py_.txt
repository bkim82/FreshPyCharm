    This function takes a message as a parameter and performs a
    character-by-character substitution on that message using the dictionary
    parameter.  The function returns the new "substituted" message.

    This function can be used for either encryption or for decryption, depending on
    the dictionary passed as a parameter. The function does not get any input from
    the user nor does it print anything to the screen.

    If a letter in the input is lowercase, it will be capitalized and then substituted.

    If a character in the message is not in the cipher dictionary, the character
    is placed directly in the output message without alteration.
